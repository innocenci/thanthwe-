THANTHWE MENTAL CHATBOT
This is an Artificial intelligence-based programming system developed in Malawi to bridge the
gap between mental health and technology. The system would be accessible through WhatsApp
and will contain features such as an information centre, a depression diagnostic centre, and
access to psychosocial assistance. Natural language processing will be used to respond to user
queries, while logic programming will be employed to determine the severity of depression.
Following diagnosis, the user will be connected to the appropriate psychological support, and
the system will follow up with the user.
To make the system available and easily accessible it will be embedded in WhatsApp to allow
those who don’t have internet bundles to access it easily and ensure that there are using a system
that almost already familiar with. This is because most youth use WhatsApp.
The systems information centre will use natural language processing to be able answer the
users queries. The use of natural processing will ensure that enough information is being
towards the users’ queries because pre-set will not provide adequate information since the
questions will have fixed answers and cannot be explored further. The official language for this
is Standard English.
The diagnostic centre will use logic programming to determine how severe the depression is.
This is because in real life for one to determine the severity of depression they ask you about
the signs and symptoms and confer with a severity chart. As such the functionality will use the
same algorithm.
After successfully conducting the diagnosis the user will be connected to the right psychosocial
support. The psychiatrist will be assisting the user accordingly but the system will follow up at
the end of the assistance.
